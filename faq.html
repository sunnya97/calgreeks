									<h3 class="major">Why CalGreeks?</h3>
									<p>For more than 130 years, fraternities and sororities at Cal have had a rich tradition of campus leadership and community involvement. Cal has 69 fraternities and sororities whose members enjoy life-long friendships and develop leadership skills under a common fraternal bond that can be experienced by your child.</p>

									<p>CalGreeks are involved in community and campus service, contributing countless hours and financial resources to the local area. CalGreeks’ fraternity and sorority chapter members are leaders in bridging gaps in our community by reaching out to varying educational and age groups.</p>

									<p>CalGreeks members actively participate in campus traditions such as Homecoming, Trick or Greek at Halloween, and Welcome Week. Intramural sports are also an integral part of the CalGreeks experience. Chapters field teams in football, volleyball, hockey, soccer, softball, and basketball among many others.</p>

									<h3 class="major">How does fraternity and sorority life contributes to the goal of “education”?  Will it impact my grades?</h3>
									<p>The goal of Greek Organizations is to support members to achieve the highest level of academic success. Being Greek is a time commitment, but one of the core values of all fraternities is academic excellence. Each chapter sets standards for academic expectations. If members do not meet their requirements, there are several resources available for students to receive assistance such as study sessions and tutoring. Some organizations even offer scholarships for high performing members. The Greek community realizes the importance of a quality education, and academic excellence should always be a priority. However, ultimately it is up to each member to prioritize between academic obligations and organizational expectations.</p>

									<h3 class="major">How does CalGreeks help develop skills outside the classroom?</h3>
									<p>CalGreeks members are leaders. The Cal fraternity and sorority community offers numerous opportunites to gain valuable leadership experience. In addition to the four governing councils, each chapter lects officers such as president and treasurer, and all members have the opportunity to attend regional and national training conferences.</p>

									<h3 class="major">What kind of practical benefits does CalGreeks membership offer?</h3>
									<p>Many immediate benefits are received through CalGreeks membership, including numerous leadership possibilities, academic encourage, student housing, and philanthropic opportunities. CalGreeks members offer their time and talent to a number of local and national charities. Community service and philanthropic events organized each year include helping local food banks, visiting childrens hospitals, and assisting at blood drives.</p>



									<h3 class="major">What kind of friendships develop in the CalGreeks community?</h3>
									<p>College friendships last a lifetime because students share in the unique experience that help them grow into tomorrow’s leaders. Residence hall and class friends will enrich the life of your child; however, friends who share the CalGreeks experience remain deeply commited to each other throughout life because they share a common experience with chapter brothers/sisters and fraternity/sorority ritual ceremonies that have developed across generations.</p>

									<h3 class="major">What kind of a time commitment can I expect to give?</h3>
									<p>Participating in a Greek organization does requires a time investment. The old saying “you get out of it what you’re willing to put into it” also applies when making the decision to join a fraternity. Most of our Greek students balance academics, a part-time job, and a social life alongside chapter membership. While there are mandatory commitments that you will be made aware of in advance (i.e. weekly meetings, community service projects, new member education, etc.), a student can be as involved as they choose to be. Time requirements vary from group to group depending on the programming calendar of the chapter. According to many of the men in our community,  the members  that are most active and involved are usually the ones most satisfied with their decision to join a fraternity/sorority.</p>

									<h3 class="major">How much will it cost?</h3>
									<p>There is no set cost for membership and fees vary between chapters. Be sure to inquire as to the full cost of membership. The Greek experience should be looked at as an investment in your future. Each organization has different dues requirements, but in most cases it costs less to live in a fraternity house and pay dues than living on campus. Membership dues are collected to provide funds for chapter activities, programs, insurance and other services that will positively impact you. In fact, less than 1 percent of an average college student’s expenses go toward Greek membership. In the first year of membership, a few onetime initiation fees are assessed. After that, regular semester dues generally average about $200-$400, depending on the chapter. Most organizations offer a variety of payment plans and billing options and will supplement their income with fundraising projects. Additionally, national headquarters offer millions of dollars in scholarships and educational grants to deserving candidates each year.</p>

									<h3 class="major">How would one get involved?</h3>
									<p>Through a process commonly referred to as recruitment or “rush”. During the official week of rush most Greek groups hold a variety of recruitment events that are designed to showcase their chapters and give you a chance to get acquainted with their members. Similar to how you researched, visited, and chose to attend The University of California, you should also seek out an organization that best fits your values, personality and interests. This is a mutual selection process and we encourage you to keep an open mind. Explore as many chapters as possible in order to make the best decision for you. Evaluate each organization on merit and don’t be afraid to ask questions!</p>

									
									<h3 class="major">Are fraternities like how they are portrayed in the media?</h3>
									<p>Fraternities were founded as values-based organizations. The mission of our chapters and Greek members across the country live these values on an everyday basis. Unfortunately, the media and entertainment showcases only one aspect of the Greek community. Aside from the social benefits, there are many other facets that make up our community which aren’t typically highlighted such as community service, leadership opportunities, and philanthropy involvement that all of our organizations are expected to participate in. At The University of California, our fraternities are also held accountable for behavior that is not consistent with the University Code of Conduct or the values of the national organization.</p>
